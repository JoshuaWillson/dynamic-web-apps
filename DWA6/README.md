Book Connect:

This application provides a list of books by title and author, accompanied by the book image. Each book item in the list can be clicked for more 
information such as the year the book was published, and the blurb. There is a night and day mode located in the settings for the comfort of the user, depending 
on the time of day. The built in search function allows users to filter the book list by genre and author as well as being able to type in a title, fully or
partially for matching results. Each page in the book list shows 36 books, in order to see more books, a show more button does just that.
